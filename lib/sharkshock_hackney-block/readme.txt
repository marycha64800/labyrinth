Hey Everybody meet Hackney Block. There are 4 members in this font family. It's a broad, clean, and consistent typeface that could work in any number of uses. Full punctuation, limited kerning,
and Eastern Europe characters are present. There are over 630 glyphs, most which are available in this initial 1.0 release. Spacing is naturally tight but this can be tweaked if needed with
purchase of commercial license. Latin characters not present can also be added. Just email me for more info.

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license.
If you've previously licensed the older version you're grandfathered into this version. Thank you! I also design custom fonts for businesses, logos, and many other things. If you'd like to 
leave me a donation you can use the same address via paypal. Your generosity will be most appreciated!
